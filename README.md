Desktop application for the Smart Office project

OFFICE ENVIRONMENTS
• Inefficiency of many offices can be
attributed to lack of modern systems for
everyday tasks
• External mail needs to be picked up from
mailroom
• Documents that need to be signed by other
employees need to be carried to them
• Proximity to coffee (a necessity) varies
• Everyone is tired and stressed

PROBLEM STATEMENT
• Time is wasted in a number of ways:
  • Getting packages from mailroom
  • Taking documents to other employees
  • Getting coffee from breakroom or coffee shop
• These tasks put employees at risk of getting distracted by other people and
things in the office, reducing productivity levels

OUR SOLUTION
• Introducing the SmartOffice!
• Our robots provide state-of-the-art delivery service
  • External incoming/outgoing mail
  • Internal delivery
  • Coffee delivery
• Easy-to-use desktop application for making requests
• Increases productivity levels by removing mundane time consuming tasks

We have used Unity to simulate the way our robot will work in a real office.
